  <h1>True facts about the mantis shrimp.</h1>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/tPT0bDo.jpg" alt="mantis shrimp">
  <p>Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed. They have large complex eyes and are highly coloured.</p>
  <h2>Attack</h2>
  <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong>spearers</strong> or <strong>smashers</strong>.</p>
  <p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p>
  <h2>Eyesight</h2>
  <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.</p>
  <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light, and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum. For example :</p>
